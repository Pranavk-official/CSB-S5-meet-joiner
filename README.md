# Usage 
The bot asks you for a ```AuthUser count``` while running. The required AuthUser count is the the position of logged in jecc mail id.The first id is 0 the second one is 1 and so on. For Eg:

Here my required AuthUser count is 1 as my JECC mail id is logged in as the second account.

> The bot uses keyboard hot keys to turn off the cam and mic and also to join class.So kindly avoid engaging with the meet window while joining a class is in progress.
